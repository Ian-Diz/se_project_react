## About the project

This project provides a user-friendly platform that offers clothing recommendations based on the current temperature. By integrating real-time temperature data, the system suggests appropriate attire, making it easier for users to dress comfortably according to the weather. It's a practical tool that streamlines the process of deciding what to wear while considering the day's temperature fluctuations.
